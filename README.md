# EcoHub

EcoHub is a web application aimed at promoting environmental awareness and sustainability. It provides users with various tools and resources to help them make eco-friendly choices and contribute to a greener planet. This project is extremely bare-bones as it was made in less than 24 hours for a hackathon. Feel free to make any changes and contact me at saaki.bhojanam@gmail.com.
